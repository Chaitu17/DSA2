Types of Binary Trees:

1) Full Binary Tree (or) Proper Binary Tree:
	
	Every node has 0 or 2 children.
	
2) Complete Binary Tree:
	
	All the levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last levl has all keys as left as possible.
	
3) Perfect Binary Tree:

	All the internal nodes have 2 children and all leaf nodes are on the same level.
	
4) Balanced Binary Tree:

	Height of tree is (log n) where n is the no of nodes.
	
5) Degenerate Tree (or) Pathological Tree:
	
	Every internal node has one child. Similar to a linked list.
	
6) Skewed Binary Tree:

	Tree is dominated by left nodes or right nodes.
